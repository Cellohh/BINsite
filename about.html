                    <h3>TL;DR: A long time ago a dude started hosting video game tournaments in New York City.</h3>
                    <br><br>Attack Cancel started out as <b>BIN</b>. The Best in New York City Official Tournaments
                    (BIN) was founded in 1999 by <em>Cello</em>, he wanted to hold a casual video game tournament with
                    the original Super Smash Bros on Nintendo 64. <h3><em>Years later, we are still on the scene!</em>
                    </h3>
                    <br>
                    The follow up to our original tournament was our first ever Super Smash Bros. Melee Tournament on
                    the Nintendo GameCube in the summer of 2002. We held 3 more Smash Bros. tournaments up until 2005.
                    These tournaments/events saw people traveling from all over the United States to attend and were
                    spoken highly of on gaming forums such as SmashBoards and GameFaqs. BIN and other small tournaments
                    were the foundations for the massive eSports scene we know and love today.<br><br>

                    BIN slowly faded away after the last 2005 tournament as various members shifted focus towards
                    college and other aspects of their lives. While BIN was gone many of the original participants still
                    kept on gaming and some garnered fame via gaming and other avenues of their lives. Cello always
                    wanted to bring the Best in New York City Tournaments back but couldn’t ever find the right time and
                    venue.<br><br>

                    Fast forward 14 years to January of 2019, Cello was working with a local beer brewery in NYC and
                    pitched the idea of holding a Mario Kart tournament at one of their locations, while reluctant at
                    first the owner eventually agreed. The Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tournament was a testing ground for any
                    renewed interest and the tournament was a huge success helping the location rake in some serious
                    sales numbers.<br><br>

                    <h2>Cello officially decided to bring the BIN Tournaments back!</h2> After recruiting a few local
                    sponsors, The Boogie Down Grind Café, Ski the Bronx and Gun Hill Brewery, we decided to follow up
                    with a Double Elimination Super Smash Bros. Ultimate tournament in April of 2019. Following the
                    success of the Ultimate tournament we went ahead with a smaller Single Elimination Ultimate
                    tournament to gather data/interest and form a plan for monthly events.<br><br>

                    Each tournament was slowly gaining ground and bringing people to the local bar/brewery that had no
                    idea the location existed. For the next tournament BIN decided to step away from the Nintendo
                    focused games and determined the next best title for a tournament was none other than the legend
                    itself, Street Fighter! In July of 2019 BIN had its first ever Ultra Street Fighter II
                    tournament!<br><br>

                    We were gearing up for a Mortal Kombat or Tekken tournament for the fall of 2019 but the ownership
                    of our venue changed hands and there seemed to be little to no interest in continuing the
                    tournaments by the new ownership. Not to be deterred, Cello set out to find another location to keep
                    the momentum going, this was tough as it was the end of the year and by the time March rolled
                    around, NYC and the country as a whole started to shut down due to Covid-19. This further
                    complicated things as any location we could possibly find would have extreme limits on it due to
                    social distancing which is tough to do when you have in person tournaments, they’re geared like any
                    sports venue, with a large amount of people involved.<br><br>

                    Fast forward to August of 2020 we decided to take our BIN tournaments online! <b><em>BIN held its
                            first ever online tournament</em></b> in “Quaran-Teams” a team based Smash Bros. Ultimate
                    tournament, with this new digital venue came new participants. We had players from the local scene
                    in NYC but also expanded out across the United States as well as the United Kingdom and the
                    Netherlands. “Quaran-Teams” exceeded the expectations we had of this online endeavor as everything
                    flowed smoothly and was streamed live via Cello’s Twitch channel.

                    Now that the online arena proved viable for us we held our “One Last Dance” Smash Bros. Ultimate
                    singles tournament on December 27th to close out 2020. 2021 saw Cello's family grow so he tabled the
                    eSports events for a short period and now we are anxiously looking forward to even greater success
                    with our future events! <br><br>
